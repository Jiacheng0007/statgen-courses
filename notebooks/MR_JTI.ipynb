This notebook shows the workflow for MR-JTI, which utilizes imputation to perform trait prediction according to multi-tissue relationship gene expression. MR-JTI acheives a higher prediction accuracy by leveraging multi-tissue information and also performes Causal Inference on trait and gene expression.\n",
